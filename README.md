### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**This is Dhamodharan**, I'm a web developer with a passion for creating real-world applications. I have a strong foundation in Laravel, React, Node, and Typescript and experimenting with new technologies.

I have experience in both front-end and back-end development. I would like to contribute to open-source projects. In my free time I work on my projects and yeah some of them are unfinished ðŸ˜„.
